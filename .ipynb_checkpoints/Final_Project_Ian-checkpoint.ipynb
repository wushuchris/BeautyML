    "\n",
    "The `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file is a pre-trained model used for facial landmark detection, typically in conjunction with the **dlib** library. It enables the identification of 68 specific points on a face image, corresponding to various facial features, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Landmark Points\n",
    "The 68 facial landmarks are distributed as follows:\n",
    "- **Jawline**: Points 1-17 outline the jawline.\n",
    "- **Eyebrows**: Points 18-22 correspond to the right eyebrow, and points 23-27 correspond to the left eyebrow.\n",
    "- **Nose**: Points 28-36 mark the bridge and bottom of the nose.\n",
    "- **Eyes**: Points 37-42 define the right eye, and points 43-48 define the left eye.\n",
    "- **Mouth**: Points 49-68 outline the outer and inner lips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "With this model file, it is possible to:\n",
    "1. **Detect and Extract Facial Features**: This includes identifying specific facial features like eye-mouth distances, nose width, and lip symmetry.\n",
    "2. **Analyze Symmetry and Ratios**: Calculate symmetry and ratios (e.g., golden ratio) based on the spatial relationships between landmarks. This can be valuable for facial attractiveness studies.\n",
    "3. **Pose Estimation**: The relative positions of landmarks can also help infer the orientation of the face (e.g., facing forward, angled, etc.).\n",

    "### Application in This Project\n",
    "In this project, the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file allows for extracting and analyzing geometric and symmetry-based features from facial images. These features will be used to investigate correlations between facial structures and attractiveness ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference\n",
    "This model can be obtained from the [dlib-models GitHub repository](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models).\n"
